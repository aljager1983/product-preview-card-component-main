## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (a little bit)
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the duration of my travel to a web development, this is my actual first time to use flexbox in a project. Additionally, I use the images here as a background and not as an imag element, which I feel more flexible to work with.


### Continued development

I still need to practice more on my mobile first approach. We'll actually for the most part, I'm going to need more practice. Because I still feel below the beginner knowledge.
